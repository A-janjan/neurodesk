## components

- natural language processing
- computer vision
- automation tools
- feedback loop


### Objective

Create a system that takes user requests, translates them into executable actions, and uses course correction based on feedback from screenshots or progress logs.


### core components

1. **LLM Backend** : Interprets requests and provides a plan of action.

2. **Automation** : Simulates mouse and keyboard inputs.

3. **Feedback Loop** : Captures screenshots and verifies progress using LLMs or other models.

### Probable python libraries:
- `openai` or `transformers` from HuggingFace

- Automation: `pyautogui`, `keyboard`, `pynput
- OCR: `pytesseract`, google vision api (for text recognition from screenshots)
- image processing: `pillow` , `opencv-python`

### system tools

- macOS/Linux: `xdo`, `xdotool`.

### good open‐source visual models for this task

#### OpenCLIP

OpenCLIP is an open‐source reproduction of OpenAI’s CLIP model. It encodes images and text into a shared embedding space, making it a versatile choice for interpreting GUI screenshots. Because it’s trained on diverse data, it generally captures the overall “feel” of an image—including layouts, icons, and text regions—which is useful when you want your system to determine what part of the OS interface is being shown. Moreover, it’s free, well supported by the community, and can be fine‐tuned on domain-specific data (like Ubuntu screenshots) if you need to boost its performance for your specific application.

#### Grounding DINO

If your goal includes precise object detection or localization (for example, identifying clickable buttons, window elements, or specific icons on an Ubuntu desktop), Grounding DINO is another excellent free option. It is designed for visual grounding tasks—detecting and localizing objects in images based on text prompts—and has demonstrated strong performance on a variety of tasks. Although it may require more computational resources (and a bit more integration work) compared to a general-purpose encoder like OpenCLIP, it can offer finer granularity when you need to simulate mouse clicks or interpret detailed layouts.
